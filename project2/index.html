				<p>Rasgulla, Rasagola or Roshogolla (Bengali: রসগোল্লা Roshogolla, Odia: ରସଗୋଲା Rasagola) is a South Asian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.

The dish originated in the Eastern part of Indian Sub-continent; the present-day Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasgulla' target='blank' title='Source'>Source</a></p>
